# Rockbox for Sphinxmoth iPods

Everything Rockbox-related for the [Sphinxmoth](https://github.com/dantidote/sphinxmoth)
flash mod for FireWire iPods (1G, 2G, 3G): the driver patch, ready-to-copy
builds, and the workflow that produces them.

## Which file do I need?

| Your bridge image | 1G/2G | 3G |
|---|---|---|
| `v1.1-mg132-fix3b` (every board shipped so far) | [`releases/4.0-ipod1g2g/rockbox.ipod.fix3b-gateware`](releases/4.0-ipod1g2g/) (tested) | [`releases/4.0-ipod3g/rockbox.ipod.fix3b-gateware`](releases/4.0-ipod3g/) (untested) |
| raw-pad PIO passthrough image (newer) | [`releases/4.0-ipod1g2g/rockbox.ipod`](releases/4.0-ipod1g2g/) (crash fix only) or any Rockbox dev build | stock Rockbox 4.0 |

Install Rockbox 4.0 with Rockbox Utility, then in disk mode copy the file
over `.rockbox/rockbox.ipod`, renaming it to `rockbox.ipod`. The READMEs in
each folder carry checksums and details. Swap only that one file: codecs
and plugins must come from the same release as the main binary.

The same files are served from [wunkuslabs.com/guide](https://wunkuslabs.com/guide#rockbox).

## Why Rockbox needs help on this board

Two separate things:

1. **Rockbox 4.0 crashes at boot on every iPod 1G/2G**, flash mod or not
   (`Data abort at 0006e8ec`, an unaligned halfword store in the PP5002
   core-wake assembly). Rockbox fixed it upstream on 2025-08-04, after the
   4.0 branch point, so dev builds are fine and the next release will be.
   The 3G release happens not to be affected. Our 4.0 files carry the
   seven-byte fix.

2. **Rockbox's PP5002 ATA driver uses one fixed, fast IDE timing** (0x10)
   tuned for the original Toshiba drive. The fix3b bridge image passes PIO
   data through a clock synchroniser, which adds about 45 ns to every
   register read; at 80 MHz that is more than the PP5002 tolerates, and
   init fails with `ATA error: -11` or `-32`. Slowing the timing exposes a
   second problem: Rockbox's PIO write loop never waits for the controller,
   so with a slower bus the controller drops words and every write fails
   with `-4`.

`pp5002-sphinxmoth.patch` fixes the second problem at the source, the way
the retail firmware and Rockbox's own PP502x port already do: select the
IDE timing from the CPU clock, and wait for the controller's idle bit after
each data word. `upstream-commit-message.txt` is the message for sending
it to Rockbox; once merged, this repo becomes unnecessary for new releases.

The hand-patched 4.0 binaries in `releases/` predate the source patch and
pin the CPU at 80 MHz instead of keying the timing to the clock; they are
what has actually been tested on hardware.

## Automated builds

`.github/workflows/build.yml` builds Rockbox for `ipod1g2g` and `ipod3g`
with the patch applied. It also carries Rockbox's own core-wake fix
(`upstream-core-wake-c33602375.patch`, the upstream commit verbatim) and
applies it when the ref being built predates that commit, so 4.0-based
builds do not inherit the boot crash; on newer refs it is detected as
already present and skipped. The workflow runs:

- **Weekly** (Monday 06:17 UTC): finds the newest upstream release tag
  (`vX.Y` or `vX.Y-final`) and, if there is no `rockbox-<tag>-sphinxmoth`
  release here yet, builds and publishes one.
- **On demand** (Actions, "Run workflow"): any Rockbox ref; `publish`
  controls whether a release is created. Building `master` publishes a
  rolling prerelease.

The arm-elf-eabi toolchain (`tools/rockboxdev.sh --target=a`, gcc 9.5) is
built once and cached; the first run takes 20 to 30 minutes.

Each release carries `rockbox-ipod1g2g-sphinxmoth.ipod`,
`rockbox-ipod3g-sphinxmoth.ipod`, a full `.zip` install for each, and
`SHA256SUMS.txt`.

**A build that compiles is not a build that works.** The workflow tests
nothing on hardware. Before a workflow build replaces a tested file here or
on the website, boot it on a fix3b board, do a write (plug in FireWire and
let Rockbox flush to disk mode), and play a track. If the patch stops
applying because upstream changed the driver, the workflow fails at the
"Apply the Sphinxmoth patch" step; check whether upstream now carries the
fix before rebasing.

## License

The patch is offered under Rockbox's license (GPL v2 or later). The
binaries in `releases/` are Rockbox 4.0 release builds with the changes
described in their READMEs; Rockbox source is at
https://git.rockbox.org/.
